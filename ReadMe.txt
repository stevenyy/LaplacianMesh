Cotangent Weights: Homer raises his arm more smoothly when cotagent weights are used in laplacian mesh editing, compared to umbrella weights. The difference is shown in the screenshots "weights/umbrella" and "weights/cotangent".

Laplacian Spectrum: In the example using homer, as I transition from eigenvectors which have small eigenvalues to those which have largers ones, the "red" part on homer becomes smaller and less concentrated. When the eigenvalue is large then all parts of the graph have similar color.
